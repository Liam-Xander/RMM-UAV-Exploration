# RMM-UAV-Exploration

This repository will host the official implementation for our research on integrating the Random Mapping Method (RMM) into a complete UAV autonomous exploration system.

## Project Overview

Our research aims to leverage the high-fidelity, lightweight, and complete map representations generated by RMM to achieve more efficient and safer autonomous exploration for UAVs in complex environments. This project is divided into two main phases:

* **Phase 1: Real-Time Mapping Framework (Completed)**
    * This phase focuses on the first-ever integration of the RMM framework with a UAV exploration system for real-time, high-fidelity mapping.
    * The results of this work have been accepted for publication at IROS 2025.
    * **Paper:** Xingyu Li, et al. "Real-Time Occupancy Grid Mapping Using RMM on Large-scale and Unstructured Environments," *2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)*. [Link to paper will be added upon publication]

* **Phase 2: Planner-Aware Exploration (Ongoing)**
    * This ongoing research focuses on leveraging the enhanced map qualities (e.g., completeness and high fidelity) from the RMM framework to directly inform and improve the planner's decision-making process.

## Open-Source Plan & Code Status

**Please note that the source code is not yet publicly available.**

Our commitment is to provide a complete, robust, and well-documented codebase for the community. To ensure the release reflects the full value of our integrated system, **we plan to make this repository public following the acceptance of our follow-up paper detailing the work from Phase 2.**

We believe this approach will provide a more holistic and powerful tool for other researchers.

## Stay Updated

We are fully committed to open-sourcing our research. Please **Star** or **Watch** this repository to be notified of future updates and the public release of the code.
